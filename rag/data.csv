Ensure resources are available to provide incentives in accordance with the law.
Local facilities can make changes to national policy, but if they do, the local Union may invoke negotiations.

Eligibility is determined by the inmate’s offense history. Those serving a sentence for a disqualifying offense or with a previous disqualifying conviction cannot earn FTC.
Besides FTC, the FSA offers additional incentives for inmates completing EBRR programs, and this statement explains the awarding process.
3. Definitions:

Incentive: A tangible reward for inmates participating in EBRR Programs based on needs identified through the Risk and Need Assessment process.
EBRR Program: Defined by the FSA; a list of approved programs is available on the agency’s websites.
Successful Participation: For an inmate to be considered as successfully participating, they must:
Attend all program sessions, except when excused.
Finish all assigned tasks and homework.
Abide by the rules and guidelines given by the program instructor."

They manage the distribution of funds to facilitate the purchase and funding of these incentives. The Regional Office also ensures that there's oversight for these initiatives by assigning the Senior Deputy Regional Director. This personnel not only supervises the incentives but ensures that all queries from facilities get answered. Additionally, they track trends to determine which incentives are having the greatest impact in encouraging program involvement."

After program completion, institutions have to update the SENTRY system accordingly and ensure that the right incentives are awarded to the deserving individuals."
